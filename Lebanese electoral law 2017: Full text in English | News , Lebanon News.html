 After years of wrangling, Lebanese lawmakers passed a new vote law in 
June that will govern the parliamentary elections slated for Spring 
2018. The move marks a major step forward for the country, as political 
work had ground to a halt while lawmakers focused solely on agreeing the
 final text.</p>

<p>Unlike the former winner takes all system, the new law will see 
proportional representation implemented for the first time in Lebanon. 
Candidates will be able to vote from anywhere in the country – through 
so-called magnetic voting cards – rather than having to travel to their 
district.</p>

<p>While no single bloc claimed dominance and the final agreement left 
out several major points called for by certain parties, it was praised 
as the first fully home-grown electoral law. It remains hard to predict 
how the new system of voting - with its new proportional representation,
 redrawn districts and preferential votes - will affect the outcome.</p>

<p>However, analysts and experts who looked at the text soon after it 
was published said they expect to see the share of seats decrease 
somewhat for many of the major parties. With the reduction expected to 
be largely uniform across the spectrum, it hasn’t been treated as a 
significant loss by the major blocs. That said, several experts believe 
Hezbollah, through affiliated parties and candidates, could 
significantly increase their share of seats in parliament.</p>

<p>While it won’t be included in the next elections, Foreign Minister 
and head of the Free Patriotic Movement Gebran Bassil’s call for six MPs
 to be assigned for the diaspora has been heeded and the framework has 
been written into the new vote law. However, it will require a further 
Cabinet decree at some point after the next election to see it activated
 in future cycles, which could also come with significant wrangling and 
opposition.</p>

<p>The 11-month so-called “technical extension” of Parliament’s term is 
to educate voters and overseers on the new law to facilitate a smooth 
process.</p>

<p>In an effort to assist in this endeavor, The Daily Star has 
translated the full text of the new vote as closely to the original 
Arabic wording as possible.&nbsp; - The Daily Star</p>
